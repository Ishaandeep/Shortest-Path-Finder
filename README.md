# Shortest Path Finder

This project is made on the principle of Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shorted distance between the two nodes.
This App is made using React.

## Play with this

1. Add wall between the starting node and the destination node
2. This project will find the shorted path between both
3. This project uses Dijkstra's Algorithm
